Dungeons and Terrarians adds the 13 damage types from Dungeons and Dragons into Terraria.
The bestiary will show contact damage, resistances, vulnerabilities, and immunities for each NPC.

A future update will add items to enhance damage types, and even add damage resistances to certain armors.

The mod has calls to add support for your own mods.
There will not be any intergrated mod support into this mod.
